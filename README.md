# UConsultant Bot
This is a toy project that I used to explore langchain and the use of tools for LLMs.  It is a simple AI assistant that helps users assemble a sequence of courses to take from the Udacity catalog.

## Setup
Create a virtual environment, activate it, and install dependencies in the usual way
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Development
Run and interact with the bot at http://localhost:8501
```
streamlit run uconsultant.py
```
